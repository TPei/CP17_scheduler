# CP 17 scheduling component [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TPei/CP17_scheduler.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/TPei/CP17_scheduler)

A service that receives inputs via a REST endpoint and then continuously schedules new infection spreading for a pandemic game session using sidekiq.

It mainly acts as a timer, calling a REST endpoint on the main service to simply notify that it's time for a new wave ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. 

## How to run
`docker-compose up -d` (-d so that you don't connect to the log console)
Go to: http://localhost:4567/v1/

## Running specs
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `docker exec -it cp17scheduler_web_1 /bin/bash` to connect to a shell
- `bundle exec rspec` to run tests
- `bundle exec rubocop` to run linter
